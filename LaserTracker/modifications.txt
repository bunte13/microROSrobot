This robot percieves the surrouning area using the lidar sensor within a certain degree angle
the degrees are beeing calculated from the front of the robot clockwise,
Once it reaches 180 degrees, the angle is calculated as  angle = 360 - angle, which means the robot makes calculations from 0 to 180 to the right,
and from 0 to - 180 to the left.
this way we can set the Priorityangle and the LaserAngle using abs(). - absolute value
PriorityAngle is the angle to which the robot will adjust itself within the newly added modification***
LaserAngle is the angle which it will register the objects

Modification added:

the robot will not move its wheels while the nearest object is withing abs(30 degrees)

This means that once the robot has positioned himself within 30 degrees of the nearest object, we can activate function: mono_Tracker.py
,select the nearest object and follow it.

This way we could monitor the object more precisely using just the camera within those 30 degrees,
once the object has left thise 30 degrees a message to the wheel nodes will be sent to reposition themselves, and the object will once again be in 
the camera's site.
