Modifications added:

1.user can now select the thickness of the brush and the eraser by spreading his index finger and middle finger.

2.while adjusting the thickness the rectangle that appeared before between the fingers is dismissed,
instead ,now there is a circle which's radius is adjusted dynamically and corresponds with the thickness of the brush/eraser.This way you will know
the thickness of the brush you are working with.

4.Added an undo function where in imgCanvasHistory[] every addition of the screen while drawing is placed and can be undone by clicking "u".

5.Also now the screen is flipped for a better user-friendly experience.
